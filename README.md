# Crosswords

This is a web application to randomly generate crosswords based on a
set of clues, and allow those crosswords to be completed through an
HTML game interface.

To run this app, you must place a tab-separated values file of clues
at resources/clues.tsv. The first column should be clue txt, the
second column should be an all-caps solution.
